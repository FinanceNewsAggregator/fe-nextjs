    article: "Tesla has unveiled its long-awaited electric semi-truck, named Tesla Semi, which aims to revolutionize the long-haul trucking industry by offering a more sustainable and efficient means of transportation. The electric truck boasts an impressive range of up to 500 miles on a single charge, allowing it to compete with traditional diesel trucks in terms of distance traveled between refueling stops. The Tesla Semi is also designed to reduce operating costs, as electric powertrains require less maintenance and have lower energy costs than their diesel counterparts. In addition to its electric powertrain, the Tesla Semi is equipped with Enhanced Autopilot, which includes advanced driver assistance features such as lane-keeping, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. These features are designed to improve safety and reduce driver fatigue on long trips, making the trucking industry safer and more efficient. The truck's aerodynamic design further contributes to its efficiency, with a drag coefficient lower than that of a supercar. Production of the Tesla Semi is scheduled to begin in 2023, with pre-orders already being accepted. The truck is expected to have a significant impact on the shipping industry, as companies seek to reduce their carbon footprint and lower operating costs. As the transition to electric vehicles accelerates, Tesla's Semi could play a crucial role in shaping the future of transportation and logistics, driving a cleaner and more sustainable future for the trucking industry.",
